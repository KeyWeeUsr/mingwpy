The goal of *mingwpy* project is to provide a free toolchain for building Python extensions for Windows OS, and make sure that those extensions are compatible with CPython compiled with native Visual Studio.

*mingwpy* toolchain contains customized GCC compiler of the [GNU toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_toolchain) based on the [Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org) and the [mingw-builds](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds) projects.
